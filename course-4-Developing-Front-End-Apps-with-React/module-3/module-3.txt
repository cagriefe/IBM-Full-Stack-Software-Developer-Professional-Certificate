### Hooks and Form Management in React

The useEffect hook in React enables the execution of side effects within functional components. In React's useEffect hook, dependencies refer to variables or values that determine when useEffect should run.

Custom hooks allow you to abstract complex logic and easily reuse it across different components in your application.

External services are any program, platform, or infrastructure your application uses to connect to and work with other applications over a network.

APIs enable you to acquire data, execute operations, or add extra features to your application.

Within React, components typically manage form data.

React inputs are classified into two categories: controlled and uncontrolled. In uncontrolled input, React puts the value on the page, and the browser keeps track of the rest. Controlled inputs, require you to write the code to manage the value explicitly.

Access control methods are frameworks for regulating access to physical or digital resources. There are two types of access control methods: traditional and innovative.




### Application State Management with Redux

The Redux elements involved in updating the component properties include actions, the Store, and reducers.

Redux makes use of the entire application's states as opposed to using component states.

Within Redux, the existing application states reside within an object known as the store.

You use action objects to communicate to the store what data you need to update and use reducers to tell the application how to make the update. 

Reducers are pure functions that receive the current state and an action object and return a new state with the actions performed.

Synchronous operations run in a first-to-last sequence, beginning the next operation only after the previous one has finished. 

Asynchronous operations can occur in parallel. They don't require the previous operation to be completed before beginning the next.
