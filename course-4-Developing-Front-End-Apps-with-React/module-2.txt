### Introduction to Function Components

Props principles include reusability, unidirectional data flow, customization, and composition.

You can use the "useState" hook with an event to control a child component.

You use component composition to combine smaller components to create a complex UI. 

Principles of component composition include abstraction, reusability, hierarchy, props and children, and higher-order components.

State management allows you to manage data that can change over time within a component.

The useState hook enables function components to manage the component's state locally.

You can use this syntax when using the useState hook:

Call the "useState" function and pass in the initial state as a parameter.

Assign the return value to a const array variable using a destructured array.

The array has two values: the state name and the state name prefixed with the keyword "set."

The mounting phase initializes the component, sets up the initial state, and performs side effects.

In the updating phase, React re-invokes the function body and re-evaluates JSX.

In the unmounting phase, React executes cleanup operations when removing a component from the DOM.
