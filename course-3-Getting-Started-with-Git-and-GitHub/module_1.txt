## Due to a distributed version control system, Git enables you to revert to the previous state or review the projectâ€™s history.

## GitHub is one of the most popular web-hosted services for Git repositories.

## Repositories are storage structures that store documents, including application source code, and enable contributors to track and maintain version control.

## Git repository model

    # Primarily focused on tracking source code during development.
