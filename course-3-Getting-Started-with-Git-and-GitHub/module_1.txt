#### Getting Started with Git and GitHub

## Git is a versatile version control system used for tracking changes in code and collaborating with others on software projects.

## Due to a distributed version control system, Git enables you to revert to the previous state or review the projectâ€™s history.

## GitHub is one of the most popular web-hosted services for Git repositories.

## Repositories are storage structures that store documents, including application source code, and enable contributors to track and maintain version control.

## Git repository model

    # Primarily focused on tracking source code during development.

    # Contains elements to coordinate among programmers, track changes, and support non-linear workflows.

## Repositories are storage structures that can hold Code, track Issues, and enable you to collaborate with others.

## GitHub enables you to create repositories, edit files using the web interface, commit the changes to the file, upload the files, and a lot more.



##### Branches with GitHub

## A branch is a snapshot of your repository to which you can make changes. 

## In the child branch, you can build, make edits, test the changes, and then merge them with the main branch. 

## To ensure that changes are made by one member, do not impede or affect the workflow of other members, multiple branches can be created and merged with the main branch.

## A pull request is a way to notify other team members of the changes and edits made to the main branch. 



Terms and definitions:

- Branch: A separate line of development that allows working on features or fixes independently.
- Clone: A local copy of the remote Git repository on the computer.
- Commit: A snapshot of the project's current state at a specific point in time, along with a description of the changes made.
- Continuous delivery (CD): The automated movement of software through the software development lifecycle.
- Continuous integration (CI): A software development process in which developers integrate new code into the code base at least once a day.
- Distributed version control system (DVCS): A system that keeps track of changes to code, regardless of where it is stored. Multiple users work on the same codebase or repository, mirroring the codebase on their computers if needed, while the distributed version control software helps manage synchronization amongst the various codebase mirrors.
- Fork: A copy of a repository into your GitHub account.
- GitHub: A web-hosted service for the Git repository.
- GitHub branches: A branch stores all files in GitHub. Branches are used to isolate changes to code. When the changes are complete, they can be merged back into the main branch.
- GitLab: A complete DevOps platform delivered as a single application. It provides access to Git repositories, controlled by source code management.
- Git: Free and open-source software distributed under the GNU General Public License. It is a distributed version control system that allows users to have a copy of their own project on their computer anywhere in the world.
- Merge: A process to combine changes from one branch to another, typically merging a feature branch into the main branch.
- Pull request: A process used to request that someone review and approve your changes before they become final.
- Repository: A data structure for storing documents, including application source code. It contains the project folders that are set up for version control.
- SSH Protocol: A method for secure remote login from one computer to another.
- Version control: A system that allows you to keep track of changes to your documents. This process allows you to recover older versions of the documents if any mistakes are made.
- Working directory: A directory in your file system that contains files and subdirectories on your computer that are associated with a Git repository.
