### Service Models

## With IaaS, the cloud provider manages physical resources. 

## With PaaS, the provider manages the platform infrastructure. 

## In the SaaS model, the provider hosts and manages the applications and data.

## Infrastructure-as-a-Service is a form of cloud computing that delivers fundamental computer, network, and storage resources to consumers on-demand, over the network, on a pay-as-you-go basis. 

## The key components of cloud infrastructure are:

    # Physical data centers

    # Compute

    # Network

    # Storage

## Platform-as-a-Service is a cloud computing model that provides customers with a complete platform—hardware, software, and infrastructure. 

## The high level of abstraction, support services, runtime environments, rapid deployment mechanisms, and middleware capabilities distinguishes PaaS clouds.

 ## PaaS advantages are:

    # Scalability

    # Faster time to market products and services.

    # Greater agility and innovation

## Software-as-a-Service is a cloud offering that provides users with access to a service provider’s cloud-based software. 

 ## SaaS characteristics are:

    # Multitenant architecture 

    # Security, compliance, and maintenance

    # Customization of applications

    # Subscription model

    # Scaling

 ## SaaS advantages are:

    # Direct procurement of solutions

    # Improved workforce productivity and efficiency

    # Enable distribution of software costs


### Deployment Models

## Deployment models indicate where the infrastructure resides, who owns and manages it, and how cloud resources and services are made available to users. There are four main deployment models available on the cloud—public, private, hybrid, and community.

## In the public cloud model, the service provider owns, manages, provisions, and maintains the physical infrastructure such as data centers, servers, networking equipment, and storage, with users accessing virtualized computing, networking and storage resources as services.

## In the private cloud model, the provider provisions the cloud infrastructure for exclusive use by a single organization. The private cloud infrastructure can be internal to the organization and run or on-premises. Or it can be on a public cloud, as in the case of Virtual Private Clouds (VPC), and be owned, managed, and operated by the cloud provider.

## In the hybrid cloud model, an organization’s on-premise private cloud and a third-party, public cloud are connected as a single, flexible infrastructure that leverages the features and benefits of both Public and Private clouds.

## In the community cloud model, the provider provisions the cloud infrastructure for use by a community of organizations with shared concerns. One or more of the organizations in the community, a third-party provider, or both are responsible for the ownership, management, and operation of this infrastructure.
