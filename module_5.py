### APIs and Data Collection

## APIs

# Pandas is an API

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

dict_={'a':[11,21,31],'b':[12,22,32]}

# When you create a Pandas object with the dataframe constructor, in API lingo this is an "instance". The data in the dictionary is passed along to the pandas API. You then use the dataframe to communicate with the API.
df=pd.DataFrame(dict_)
type(df)

# When you call the method head the dataframe communicates with the API displaying the first few rows of the dataframe.
df.head()

# When you call the method mean, the API will calculate the mean and return the value.
df.mean()



## REST APIs

# It's quite simple to use the nba api to make a request for a specific team. We don't require a JSON, all we require is an id. This information is stored locally in the API. We import the module teams.
from nba_api.stats.static import teams
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def one_dict(list_dict):
    keys=list_dict[0].keys()
    out_dict={key:[] for key in keys}
    for dict_ in list_dict:
        for key, value in dict_.items():
            out_dict[key].append(value)
    return out_dict

# The method get_teams() returns a list of dictionaries.
nba_teams = teams.get_teams()

# The dictionary key id has a unique identifier for each team as a value. Let's look at the first three elements of the list:
nba_teams[0:3]

# To make things easier, we can convert the dictionary to a table. First, we use the function one dict, to create a dictionary. We use the common keys for each team as the keys, the value is a list; each element of the list corresponds to the values for each team. We then convert the dictionary to a dataframe, each row contains the information for a different team.
dict_nba_team=one_dict(nba_teams)
df_teams=pd.DataFrame(dict_nba_team)
df_teams.head()

#Will use the team's nickname to find the unique id, we can see the row that contains the warriors by using the column nickname as follows:
df_warriors=df_teams[df_teams['nickname']=='Warriors']
df_warriors

# We can use the following line of code to access the first column of the DataFrame:
id_warriors=df_warriors[['id']].values[0][0]
# we now have an integer that can be used to request the Warriors information 
id_warriors



## Practice Project: GDP Data extraction and processing

#An international firm that is looking to expand its business in different countries across the world has recruited you. You have been hired as a junior Data Engineer and are tasked with creating a script that can extract the list of the top 10 largest economies of the world in descending order of their GDPs in Billion USD (rounded to 2 decimal places), as logged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd



# You can also use this section to suppress warnings generated by your code:
def warn(*args, **kwargs):
    pass
import warnings
warnings.warn = warn
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
URL="https://web.archive.org/web/20230902185326/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29"

# Extract tables from webpage using Pandas. Retain table number 3 as the required dataframe.
tables = pd.read_html(URL)
df = tables[3]

# Replace the column headers with column numbers
df.columns = range(df.shape[1])

# Retain columns with index 0 and 2 (name of country and value of GDP quoted by IMF)
df = df[[0,2]]
# Retain the Rows with index 1 to 10, indicating the top 10 economies of the world.
df = df.iloc[1:11:]
# Assign column names as "Country" and "GDP (Million USD)"
df.columns = ['Country','GDP (Million USD)']
df

# Change the data type of the 'GDP (Million USD)' column to integer. Use astype() method.
df['GDP (Million USD)'] = df['GDP (Million USD)'].astype(int)

# Convert the GDP value in Million USD to Billion USD
df[['GDP (Million USD)']] = df[['GDP (Million USD)']]/1000

# Use numpy.round() method to round the value to 2 decimal places.
df[['GDP (Million USD)']] = np.round(df[['GDP (Million USD)']], 2)

# Rename the column header from 'GDP (Million USD)' to 'GDP (Billion USD)'
df.rename(columns = {'GDP (Million USD)' : 'GDP (Billion USD)'})

# Load the DataFrame to the CSV file named "Largest_economies.csv"
df.to_csv('./Largest_economies.csv')
df



## HTTP and Requests

# Requests
import requests

import os 
from PIL import Image
from IPython.display import IFrame

# You can make a GET request via the method get to www.ibm.com:
url='https://www.ibm.com/'
r=requests.get(url)

# We have the response object r, this has information about the request, like the status of the request. We can view the status code using the attribute status_code.
r.status_code

# You can view the request headers:
print(r.request.headers)

# You can view the request body, in the following line, as there is no body for a get request we get a None:
print("request body:", r.request.body)

# You can view the HTTP response header using the attribute headers. This returns a python dictionary of HTTP response headers.
header=r.headers
print(r.headers)

# We can obtain the date the request was sent using the key Date.
header['date']

# Content-Type indicates the type of data:
header['Content-Type']

# You can also check the encoding:
r.encoding

# As the Content-Type is text/html we can use the attribute text to display the HTML in the body. We can review the first 100 characters:
r.text[0:100]


# Use single quotation marks for defining string
url='https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/IDSNlogo.png'

# We can make a get request:
r=requests.get(url)

# We can look at the response header:
print(r.headers)

# We can see the 'Content-Type'
r.headers['Content-Type']

# An image is a response object that contains the image as a bytes-like object. As a result, we must save it using a file object. First, we specify the file path and name
path=os.path.join(os.getcwd(),'image.png')

# We save the file, in order to access the body of the response we use the attribute content then save it using the open function and write method:
with open(path,'wb') as f:
    f.write(r.content)

# We can view the image:
Image.open(path)



#Write the commands to download the txt file in the given link.
URL = 'https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%205/data/Example1.txt'

path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'content1.txt')
r = requests.get(URL)
with open(path, 'wb') as f:
    f.write(r.content)
    
    
import json    
## Get Request with URL Parameters

url_get='http://httpbin.org/get'

# A query string is a part of a uniform resource locator (URL), this sends other information to the web server. The start of the query is a ?, followed by a series of parameter and value pairs, as shown in the table below. The first parameter name is name and the value is Joseph. The second parameter name is ID and the Value is 123. Each pair, parameter, and value is separated by an equals sign, =. The series of pairs is separated by the ampersand &.

# To create a Query string, add a dictionary. The keys are the parameter names and the values are the value of the Query string.
payload={"name":"Joseph","ID":"123"}

# Then passing the dictionary payload to the params parameter of the  get() function:
r=requests.get(url_get,params=payload)

# We can print out the URL and see the name and values.
r.url

# There is no request body.
print("request body:", r.request.body)

# We can print out the status code.
print(r.status_code)

# We can view the response as text:
print(r.text)

# We can look at the 'Content-Type'.
r.headers['Content-Type']

# As the content 'Content-Type' is in the JSON format we can use the method json(), it returns a Python dict:
r.json()

# The key args has the name and values:
r.json()['args']



## Post Requests

# Like a GET request, a POST is used to send data to a server, but the POST request sends the data in a request body. In order to send the Post Request in Python, in the URL we change the route to POST:
url_post='http://httpbin.org/post'

# To make a POST request we use the post() function, the variable payload is passed to the parameter  data :
r_post=requests.post(url_post,data=payload)

# Comparing the URL from the response object of the GET and POST request we see the POST request has no name or value pairs.
print("POST request URL:",r_post.url )
print("GET request URL:",r.url)

# We can compare the POST and GET request body, we see only the POST request has a body:
print("POST request body:",r_post.request.body)
print("GET request body:",r.request.body)

# We can view the form as well:
r_post.json()['form']
