### Introduction to Databases 

Structured Query Language, or SQL, was designed to manage data in relational databases and is useful for handling structured data. 

Data is a collection of facts in words, numbers, and pictures. 

A database is a repository of data that provides functionality for adding, modifying, and querying data. 

Relational databases store tabular data as collections of related items, with columns containing item properties. 

The basic SQL statements are CREATE TABLE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE. 

Non-relational databases provide a flexible and scalable approach to storing and retrieving data.

Relational databases are ideal for the optimized storage, retrieval, and processing of large volumes of data. 

RDBMS is a mature and well-documented technology, providing flexibility, reduced redundancy, ease of backup and disaster recovery, and ACID compliance. 

An Entity-Relationship model is a tool for designing relational databases. Entities become tables, and attributes are translated into columns. 


### Basic SQL Statements

Structured Query Language, or SQL, is used for querying and managing data. 

SQL is useful for handling structured data or data incorporating relations among entities and variables.

The SQL SELECT statement retrieves data from a relational database table. 

The SELECT statement is a query, and the output we get from executing this query is a Result Set or a Result Table.

In its simplest form, the syntax for a SELECT statement is: SELECT * from TableName

The SQL INSERT statement inserts data into a relational database table by adding rows.

The syntax of the INSERT statement is: INSERT INTO TableNameColumnName VALUES (values)

For the INSERT statement, the values provided in the Values clause must equal the number of column names specified in the Column Name list. This ensures that each column has a value. 

The SQL UPDATE statement is used to read and modify data.

The syntax of the UPDATE statement is as follows:  UPDATE [TableName] SET [[ColumnName]=[Value]] <WHERE [Condition]>

The SQL DELETE statement is used to remove data from a table.

The syntax of the DELETE statement is: DELETE FROM [TableName] <Where [Condition]>

The WHERE clause specifies the rows in a table that will be acted on by a SQL statement such as SELECT, DELETE, or UPDATE.
