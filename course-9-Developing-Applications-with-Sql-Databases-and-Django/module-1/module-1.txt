### Introduction to Databases 

Structured Query Language, or SQL, was designed to manage data in relational databases and is useful for handling structured data. 

Data is a collection of facts in words, numbers, and pictures. 

A database is a repository of data that provides functionality for adding, modifying, and querying data. 

Relational databases store tabular data as collections of related items, with columns containing item properties. 

The basic SQL statements are CREATE TABLE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE. 

Non-relational databases provide a flexible and scalable approach to storing and retrieving data.

Relational databases are ideal for the optimized storage, retrieval, and processing of large volumes of data. 

RDBMS is a mature and well-documented technology, providing flexibility, reduced redundancy, ease of backup and disaster recovery, and ACID compliance. 

An Entity-Relationship model is a tool for designing relational databases. Entities become tables, and attributes are translated into columns.
