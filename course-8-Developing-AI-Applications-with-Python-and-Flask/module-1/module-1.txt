### Python Coding Practices and Packaging Concepts

# The application development lifecycle has seven phases, including:

Requirement Gathering: You collect user, business, and technical requirements for the app

Analysis: You analyze the requirements

Design: You design the complete solution

Code and test: You build and test the different components of the app

User and system test: Users test the app for usability, and you perform system integration testing and performance testing

Production: The application is available to all end users

Maintenance: You upgrade or fix any user or system issues

# All web apps are APIs, but not all APIs are web apps. Both share data between apps, but not all APIs require networks like web apps do.

# The PEP8 guidelines for code readability include the following:

Four spaces for indentation

Blank lines to separate functions and classes 

Spaces around operators and after commas

# The PEP8 coding conventions for consistency and manageability include:

Add larger blocks of code inside functions

Name functions and files using lowercase with underscores

Name classes using CamelCase

Name constants in capital letters with underscores separating words

# To ensure that your code adheres to the predefined style and standard without executing the code, you can use the Static code analysis method.

# Unit testing is a method to validate if code units are operating as designed. You must test every unit before integration with the final codebase.

# To create a package:

Create a folder with the package name

Create an empty __init__.py file

Create the required modules

In the __init__.py file, add code to reference the modules needed in the package

# You can verify the package via the bash terminal in a Python shell.
