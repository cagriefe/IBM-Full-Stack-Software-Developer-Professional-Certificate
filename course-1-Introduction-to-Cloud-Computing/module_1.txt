### Introduction to cloud computing

# Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing resources over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis; resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned among multiple users and scale up and down in response to users’ needs.

# The origins of cloud computing can be traced back to the mainframes of the 1950s, with virtualization technologies and hypervisors serving as catalysts for the emergence of modern-day cloud computing.

# Organizations must consider their business needs, investment viability, and risk capacity to create a cloud adoption strategy that delivers desired benefits without causing business disruptions and security, compliance, or performance issues.

# Cloud adoption is growing faster than predicted. Driving this technological wave are cloud service providers with a host of services ranging from Infrastructure, Platform, and Software services. Some major Cloud providers of our time include AWS, Alibaba Cloud, Google, IBM, and Microsoft Azure.




### Business Case for Cloud Computing

## The adoption of cloud technologies enables enterprises, big and small, to be agile, innovative, and competitive and to create differentiated customer experiences. Organizations are asking not whether they should move to the cloud but rather what strategy they should adopt to move to the cloud.

## Some case studies that demonstrate the impact businesses have created by adopting the cloud:

    # American Airlines adopting cloud technologies to deliver customer value rapidly across its enterprise
