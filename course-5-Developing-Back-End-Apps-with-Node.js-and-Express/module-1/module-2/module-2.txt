### Asynchronous I/O with Callback Programming

Asynchronous network operations can be handled using callback functions in order to prevent blocking JavaScript code  

A callback function must invoke another callback function to pass a message from the Node.js module back to the main application after the Node.js module receives a response message 

Nested callbacks can be difficult to read and debug. Inversion of control causes trust issues when dealing with third-party code 

Promise objects are most useful for operations that are time-consuming and can block resources 

JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() are two methods used to parse JSON objects 


Term	Definition
Async	Short for “asynchronous”.
Axios Package	The axios package wraps promises around HTTP requests.  It returns a promise object. 
Callback Hell	Many nested callback functions. 
Inversion of Control	When the flow of control, such as the execution of instructions, is controlled by a third party. 
Promise	An object in JavaScript that acts as a placeholder for an asynchronous task that is yet to be completed. It is the object that is returned from an asynchronous method. When you define a promise object in your script, instead of returning a value immediately, it returns a promise. The promise has three states, which are pending, fulfilled, and rejected. 
Pyramid of Doom	Another term for “callback hell”.
